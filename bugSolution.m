The corrected code addresses this by ensuring that the previous string is released before a new one is assigned:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    if (self.myString) {
        self.myString = nil; //Or [self.myString release]; in manual retain-release
    }
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

Alternatively, using ARC (Automatic Reference Counting), setting `self.myString = nil;` is sufficient.  ARC automatically handles the release of the previously assigned string.
