In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString:@"Hello"];
    // ... some code ...
}
@end
```

The issue: If `someMethod` is called multiple times, each time creating a new `NSString` object, the old string isn't released. It leaks memory. This can be solved by releasing or setting the string to nil before assigning a new one.
